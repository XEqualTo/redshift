# ðŸš€ Optimizations Added to Redshift Health Check

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Asynchronous Execution (`asyncio`)
âœ… Replaced synchronous query execution with `asyncio.gather()` to run multiple queries **concurrently**.  
âœ… Prevents blocking of queries, making execution significantly faster.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Connection Pooling (`aiopg`)
âœ… Uses **`aiopg.create_pool()`** instead of creating a new connection for each query.  
âœ… Maintains a **pool of connections** (minsize=1, maxsize=5) to reuse connections efficiently.  
âœ… Reduces **connection overhead** and **improves scalability** under high query loads.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Batch Query Execution
âœ… Instead of executing queries **one by one**, we now run **all queries concurrently** using:  
   ```python
   await asyncio.gather(*(health_check.run_check(query, name) for name, query in queries.items()))
   ```
âœ… **Reduces total execution time** since all queries are processed in parallel.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Non-Blocking CSV Writing (`aiofiles`)
âœ… Uses **`aiofiles`** to write CSV files asynchronously instead of blocking I/O operations.  
âœ… Allows the program to continue executing while writing results to disk.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Adaptive Query Execution
âœ… **Handles missing results properly** instead of blindly generating empty CSV files.  
âœ… Logs a warning message if a query returns **no data**, avoiding unnecessary file writes.  
   ```python
   if not results:
       logging.warning(f"No data for {filename}, skipping CSV export.")
   ```
âœ… Prevents **unnecessary computation** and improves storage efficiency.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Improved Error Handling & Logging
âœ… **Handles missing environment variables** (Redshift credentials) gracefully.  
âœ… Properly logs:
   - Connection failures (`psycopg2.OperationalError`)  
   - Query failures (`psycopg2.Error`)  
   - CSV write failures (`Exception handling`)  
   - Missing data warnings  
âœ… Example:
   ```python
   try:
       async with conn.cursor() as cursor:
           await cursor.execute(query)
   except psycopg2.Error as e:
       logging.error(f"Query execution failed: {e}")
   ```
âœ… **More meaningful log messages** make debugging easier.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Graceful Shutdown & Connection Management
âœ… **Ensures all database connections are closed** properly even if an error occurs.  
âœ… Uses:
   ```python
   async def close(self):
       if self.pool:
           self.pool.close()
           await self.pool.wait_closed()
           logging.info("Closed Redshift connection pool")
   ```
âœ… Prevents connection leaks, which could **exhaust database resources**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Scalable Query Execution
âœ… The program can **scale efficiently** by increasing the connection pool (`maxsize=5`).  
âœ… More queries can be added without impacting execution time.  

---
